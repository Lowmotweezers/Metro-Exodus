Works on latest Metro Exodus (PC Enhanced Edition v1.03–v1.05 patches, 4A Games / Deep Silver AC active).  
Status: Undetected low-key/closet (community tested on PC, HWID spoof — rage/AC waves ban fast if overused) 🟢🟠

Why this hack survives custom AC in 2026  
- Simple: .exe → Metro Exodus → auto-load  
- Humanized closet: smoothing, realistic FOV, no obvious animations or stats spikes  
- Kernel AC bypass — streamproof overlays, no server-side checks triggered, compatible with all DLCs (The Two Colonels & Sam’s Story)  
- ESP: enemies (human bandits, mutants, Watchmen, Nosalises, Demons, Humanimals, Shrimp, Blind Ones, bosses), NPCs (allies, traders, quest givers), loot crates, weapons, ammo, filters, collectibles (postcards, diaries, guitar songs, moral points), hidden paths, ambushes, guard patrols, weak points on armored enemies highlighted  
- Updates post-DLC/patch (new weapons like Bulldog shotgun upgrades, new locations like Novosibirsk, new moral choices)  
- No key/sub — loader style  
- Windows 10/11 64-bit (Steam / Epic Games Store / GOG)
